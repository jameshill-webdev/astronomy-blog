						"text": "Nearby is the smaller cigar galaxy, also known as Messier 82. So named because of its elongated apparent shape, this galaxy is actually a spiral, only appearing the way it does because we are viewing it almost edge-on. It is classified as a \"starburst\" galaxy owing to an unusually high rate of star formation - ten times that found in our own galaxy. This is thought to have been caused by an interaction with its larger neighbour. It also contains the brightest pulsar known, M82-X2, discovered in 2014."
