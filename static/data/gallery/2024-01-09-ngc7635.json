						"text": "To the lower-left of centre is the bubble nebula itself, one of the most spellbinding objects I've observed so far. The \"bubble\" is an almost-spherical shell of ionized gas being pushed outward by radiation from the energetic central star BD+60Â°2522. There is a smaller inner bubble with a more irregular shape, although that is far too small to be visible in my image. As in my recent picture of the flaming star and tadpole nebulae, faint nebulosity is visible throughout the background of the image, although it's more apparent this time."

It would have been nice to include the full extent of Sh2 161 in the shot, but the field of view just wasn't wide enough even with the reducer. In hindsight, a star reduction step would have been beneficial. A long-term goal is to capture a more detailed shot of the bubble nebula at higher magnification, as well as a separate image of the lobster claw."
